# FLTK Easy Setup MacOS

FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX®/Linux® (X11), Microsoft® Windows®, and MacOS® X. FLTK provides modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics via OpenGL® and its built-in GLUT emulation.

To make it as simple as possible for students to use the FLTK library this repo was made.

## Installation(Optional, not necessary)

If you want to install FLTK locally you can use Homebrew. Open a new Terminal shell and run the following commands:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
You might get asked to write your password, then do it and press Enter. Now simply run the following command to add FLTK to your computer:

```bash
brew install fltk
```

## Usage

Clone the repository either by pressing "Download ZIP" or by using Git(if you have it installed) in terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/larsgmu/PPP_FLTK_macOS.git
```
The only file you need to worry about is the main.cpp, edit it as much as you want with any C++ editor og IDE. When you are done save the file, and run the script "start.command". This file will compile and run the project automaticly.
